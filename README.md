# League-Pass-Survey-Form
practicing HTML forms, CSS design, and PHP by making a mock survey form for NBA League Pass

To Do:
* implement a mobile-first responsive design in CSS
* implement pushing the form data through to a remote database (probably AWS hosting, idk)
* improve responsivity of web elements (buttons, inputs, etc) with JavaScript
